        # if given, a chroot(2) is done to the given directory.
        # i.e. you can chroot to the working directory, for example,
        # for extra security, but make sure all files are in that directory.
        #
        # If chroot is enabled, you should pass the configfile (from the
        # commandline) as a full path from the original root. After the
        # chroot has been performed the now defunct portion of the config
        # file path is removed to be able to reread the config after a reload.
        #
        # All other file paths (working dir, logfile, roothints, and
        # key files) can be specified in several ways:
        #       o as an absolute path relative to the new root.
        #       o as a relative path to the working directory.
        #       o as an absolute path relative to the original root.
        # In the last case the path is adjusted to remove the unused portion.
        #
        # The pid file can be absolute and outside of the chroot, it is
        # written just prior to performing the chroot and dropping permissions.
        #
        # Additionally, unbound may need to access /dev/random (for entropy).
        # How to do this is specific to your OS.
